    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I searched and finally found this recipe on the internet. It is a copycat of the Bourbon Chicken sold in Chinese carry-outs in my hometown. This recipe is so good that my sons gobble it up leaving me just a spoonful. Their excuse was they thought I had eaten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 - 2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients, heating over medium heat until well mixed and dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and bring to a hard boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve over hot rice and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
